# Project state

Last updated: 2026-09-16

## Stage

**M3A — Multi-chunk Correctness is implemented locally** on `feat/m3-multichunk-foundation`, pending review/PR and merge. M2 was merged into `main` through [PR #2](https://github.com/Jovinull/veldwake/pull/2) at merge commit `b7f7461911e2f5c832dd9dae475ebb375dda870e`. The repository remains a non-playable engineering proof.

## What works

- Source provenance and SHA-256 are recorded.
- Repository constitution, ADR process, memory protocol, setup guide, and CI are defined.
- Rust stable `1.98.1` with `rustfmt` and Clippy is available on the audited Windows host.
- A dependency-free Rust 2024 foundation crate compiles and validates the workspace.
- `veldwake-client` uses current `winit 0.30` lifecycle APIs and `wgpu 30` to render the deterministic M2 voxel fixture with depth, back-face culling, and a perspective camera.
- Input, camera, surface selection, model translation, and diagnostic color behavior are covered by 14 client tests; focus loss clears held input and presentation delta is bounded.
- Startup diagnostics report the actual adapter/backend/surface configuration; lightweight presentation timing is reported every five seconds at `info`.
- `cargo-deny` and `cargo-audit` are part of the dependency gates now that runtime dependencies exist.
- `veldwake-voxel` provides a dependency-free dense `32³` chunk, checked local access, a stable diagnostic fixture, and a CPU exposed-face reference mesher with headless correctness tests.
- The client builds and meshes the static fixture chunks once at startup, converts voxel IDs to diagnostic colors in presentation code, and creates immutable GPU buffers without per-frame remeshing or upload.
- Signed `ChunkCoord(i32)` and `WorldVoxelCoord(i64)` conversions use checked Euclidean semantics; borrowed neighborhoods distinguish known voxel data from missing chunks.
- Neighbor-aware CPU meshing removes solid seams in all six directions. The deterministic three-chunk fixture has 51 solids, fingerprint `0xe65ae5533c4db16a`, and exact topology 202 quads / 808 vertices / 1,212 indices.
- The client renders the static chunks at signed offsets using immutable per-chunk model uniforms. CPU meshes remain local and the renderer still owns no authoritative world state.

## What does not exist yet

No streaming/residency/jobs, world generation, LOD, authoritative simulation, gameplay, audio, networking, save format, mod runtime, UI framework, or internal editor exists. The static fixture collection is not a world model, and the diagnostic client is not a game.

## Current decisions

- Working title: Veldwake; no legal clearance claimed.
- Custom engine in Rust; no Unity, Unreal, Godot, Bevy, or equivalent central engine.
- Planned renderer foundation: `wgpu` + WGSL + `winit` + `glam`; D3D12 is the expected initial Windows backend.
- Authoritative gameplay is presentation-independent; single-player follows a local-server-compatible boundary.
- Procedural-first audiovisual production is a defining constraint, governed by style rules and compiled caches.
- Rust versions are pinned; dependencies enter only with an immediate capability and justification.

See accepted decisions in [`adr/`](adr/README.md).

## Build, test, run

From a shell where Cargo is on `PATH`:

```text
cargo build --workspace
cargo fmt --check
cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings
cargo nextest run --workspace
cargo test --workspace --doc
cargo deny check
cargo audit
cargo run -p veldwake-client
cargo run --release -p veldwake-voxel --bin voxel-probe
```

The runnable binary is diagnostic presentation content only. See [`environment/SETUP.md`](environment/SETUP.md).

## Tools on the audited host

Git, Git LFS, GitHub CLI, Visual Studio 2022 Build Tools/MSVC, Windows SDK, LLVM, Ninja, Python, Codex CLI, rustup, Cargo, rustc, rustfmt, Clippy, cargo-nextest, cargo-deny, and cargo-audit. See the environment report for versions and tools intentionally deferred.

## Known problems and blocks

- No project license has been chosen.
- The working title lacks formal trademark/domain/store clearance.
- Target hardware tiers and memory/frame budgets are not yet approved.
- Visual style bible and accessibility baseline remain to be authored during the relevant milestones.
- The public repository is `https://github.com/Jovinull/veldwake`; changing visibility, remotes, releases, or other publication policy requires owner authorization.

## Active milestone

**M3A — Multi-chunk Correctness:** implementation and local validation are complete; review/PR and merge are next. This is a correctness submilestone, not streaming. See [`planning/M3_STREAMING_WORLD.md`](planning/M3_STREAMING_WORLD.md). Do not begin M3B without a separately reviewed scope; threads, jobs, world generation, LOD, persistence, ECS, and gameplay remain excluded.

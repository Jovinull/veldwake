# Capability roadmap

Status: **Proposed sequencing; no calendar estimates**.

Milestones are evidence gates, not dates. Each milestone must leave a small working capability, documented boundaries, representative tests, and measured risks.

## M0 — Repository & Engineering Foundation

Source preservation, environment audit, Git/workspace/toolchain, governance, memory, ADRs, quality gates, CI, and structured vision. **Complete.**

## M1 — Rendering Foundation

Window, adapter/device/surface, D3D12-first backend reporting, resize/lifecycle, frame loop, input, simple camera, clear diagnostic output, clean shutdown, and GPU-independent boundary tests. No voxel world.

**Complete and merged through PR #1:** see [`M1_RENDERING_FOUNDATION.md`](M1_RENDERING_FOUNDATION.md) for implementation and validation evidence.

## M2 — Voxel Prototype

Explicit voxel/chunk representation, one deterministic fixture chunk, edit/read API, selected baseline meshing technique, upload/render path, bounds/correctness tests, and CPU/mesh metrics.

**Active on `feat/m2-voxel-prototype`:** the CPU/headless chunk, deterministic fixture, exposed-face reference mesher, tests, and metrics probe are implemented. The minimal one-chunk GPU adapter remains. See [`M2_VOXEL_PROTOTYPE.md`](M2_VOXEL_PROTOTYPE.md).

## M3 — Streaming World

Chunk coordinates, prioritized/cancellable generation and meshing jobs, residency/streaming budgets, initial LOD strategy, cache/persistence experiment, and debug visualization. No full civilization simulation.

## M4 — Beautiful Terrain Vertical Slice

One coherent region containing terrain, biome, hydrology cues, vegetation, sky, sunlight/shadows, atmosphere/fog, water/weather subset, stable visual fixtures, and target-host performance capture.

## M5 — Procedural Character

One humanoid descriptor/compiler path, consistent voxel geometry/materials, generated skeleton, locomotion, terrain contact/IK subset, collision representation, preview/fixture pipeline, and style-rule evidence.

## M6 — Combat Slice

One weapon and one enemy with movement, attack/defense or dodge, telegraphs, hit reaction, camera response, procedural impact audio, VFX, animation, and encounter/readability playtest evidence.

## Later capability groups

Persistence/world editing, aggregate/local world simulation, settlements/history/economy, richer procedural assets/audio/music, multiplayer transport, and WASM modding follow only after the central technical and fun risks are proven. Split and order them when earlier evidence exists; do not manufacture detailed milestones now.

## Milestone exit rule

Exit requires demonstrable capability, applicable gates, current docs/state/handoff, resolved or accepted risks, and explicit exclusions for the next scope. A screenshot without tests/metrics is not a renderer milestone; infrastructure without a usable slice is not product progress.
